Built purely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project serves as both a practical study tool and a clear demonstration of core front-end development skills. 
At its heart, the application allows users to engage with interactive, flippable flashcards, each containing a question and an answer. 
Users have full control over their study deck, with the ability to dynamically add new custom cards through a simple form and remove them as concepts are mastered. 
The clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface ensures a distraction-free learning experience on any device. 
This project effectively showcases key principles of DOM manipulation and event handling, making it an ideal, lightweight solution for anyone looking to make their study sessions more efficient and interactive.
